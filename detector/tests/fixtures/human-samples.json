Meanwhile, I'm standing there with my ice cream melting. Finally gave up and switched to self-checkout, which of course didn't work either because apparently I look underage when buying cooking wine. Some days, man."

I've been trying to recreate it for years. Got close last winter, I think. The trick might be the dill. She always grew it in her backyard, next to those ugly ceramic frogs she loved so much. God, I miss her."

Tom showed up 20 minutes late, Jennifer's slides were from last quarter (she literally presented the wrong deck), and the client kept asking about deliverables we hadn't even discussed internally. I tried to pivot but honestly we just looked unprepared. Need to figure out damage control before the follow-up call Thursday."

Ended up reading half a book \u2014 one of those detective novels my dad left behind. Not great literature but it did the job. By morning the rain had stopped but everything smelled like wet earth and possibility. Or maybe just wet earth."

No. And that's the problem with so much stuff coming out now \u2014 it's all competent but nobody's taking real risks. Give me a messy, ambitious failure over a polished nothing any day. At least then you remember it."
